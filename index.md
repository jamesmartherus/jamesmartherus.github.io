<img src="/man/figures/headshot.jpeg" align="left" width=200 style="float:left; padding-right:25px" /> I am a Senior Manager on the Research Science team at Morning Consult. Before joining Morning Consult, I spent a year on the analytics team at YouGov, working on survey sampling and building high quality survey weights. In 2019, I received my PhD in Political Science from Vanderbilt University, where I was an affiliate of the [Research on Individuals, Politics, and Society](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/rips/) Lab and the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/). 

My research broadly considers how partisan group identities affect political behavior. I have two main research programs. The first focuses on partisan inter-group conflict; in particular, I identify a dangerous form of extreme affective polarization - partisan dehumanization, and study its origins and consequences. My second set of research projects focuses on partisan intra-group conflict; more specifically, how partisan social norms differ between parties and how those norms affect things like candidate selection and social interactions between party members. My work has been published in *Political Behavior* and received media coverage from the *New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, *The Economist*, *The Atlantic*, and on *Vox's* podcast *The Weeds*. 

Methodologically, my research uses surveys and experiments, computational methods like web scraping and text analysis, observational methods like regression discontinuity, and some qualitative interviews.
