I am a Senior Survey Analytics Analyst at YouGov. Prior to my current position, I received my PhD in Political Science from Vanderbilt University, where I was an affiliate of the Research on Individuals, Politics, and Society Lab and the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. 

My research is about affective polarization and its more extreme cousin - partisan dehumanization. My work is been published in Political Behavior and has received coverage from the New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, The Atlantic, and on Vox's podcast The Weeds.
